**Mostly taken from Andrey's PM notes**

In proper coordinates, gravitational potential and equations of motion for particles:

$$\nabla^2 \Phi \, = 4 \pi G \rho_{tot} - \Lambda $$

$$\frac{d\textbf{r}}{dt} \, = \,\textbf{u}$$

$$\frac{d\textbf{u}}{dt} \, = \, - \nabla \Phi$$,

time and spatial derivatives are also with respect to proper coordinates.


Now we change to comoving variables and make them dimensionless
