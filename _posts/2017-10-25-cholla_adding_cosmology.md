**Mostly taken from Andrey's PM notes**

In proper coordinates, gravitational potential and equations of motion for particles:

$$\nabla^2 \Phi \, = 4 \pi G \rho_{tot} - Lambda $$

$$\fracc{d\textbr{r}}{dt} \, = \,\textbr{u}$$

$$\fracc{d\textbr{u}}{dt} \, = \, - \nabla \Phi$$,

time and spatial derivatives are also with respect to proper coordinates.
