**Timing for Cholla performance**  ( averaged over 10 steps on a \\( 128^3 \\) per node volume )

**Description:**

Times shown in previous figure correspond the average time step for  the first 10 steps, i.e. times plotted correspond to one time step averaged over the the first 10 steps ( including the first step ).

The simulation corresponds to the collapse (adiabatic  $$ \gamma = 5/3 $$ ) of a spherical  overdensity ( $$ \rho = 0.05 $$ outside and $$ \rho=1 $$ inside )  of initial radius $$ r_0 = 0.2 $$ inmersed in a volume of side length $$ L = 1 $$ with periodic boundary conditions. Initially the pressure is uniform with a small value of $$ p = 0.01 $$
