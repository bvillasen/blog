Figures below show the differences in the Flux Power Spectrum measured in our simulations compared to the observational data. The differences are quantified by $$\chi^2$$ defined as:

$$  \chi^{2} = \sum_{i}^N \left[ \frac{ P(k_i)^{\mathrm{observ}} - P(k_i)^{\mathrm{model}} } { \sigma_i^{\mathrm{observ}} }  \right]^{2}  $$




The reduced error $$\chi^2_{\nu, \mathrm{P19}}$$ and $$\chi^2_{\nu, \mathrm{HM12}}$$ shown in the figures for each snapshot are computed as:


$$\chi^2_{\nu} = \frac{ \chi^2 }{ N } } $$ 


For the small scale  comparison the scales selected are $$ 0.01 \leq k \leq 0.1 \, \mathrm{s} \, \mathrm{km}^{-1} $$ and the measurements of $$\chi^2$$ is computed separately for each of the observational data sets.

The distribution of $$\chi^2_{\nu}$$ for the two models is summarized in the following figure:

For $$2\lesssim z \lesssim 4.5$$,  $$ \langle \chi^2_\nu \rangle   \sim 2$$ for the P19 model  compared to $$ \langle \chi^2_\nu \rangle \sim 8$$ for the HM12 model


Now comparing in the $$ k \leq 0.01 \, \mathrm{s} \, \mathrm{km}^{-1} $$ range:

For the large scale comparison with the eBOSS data the differences are much larger
