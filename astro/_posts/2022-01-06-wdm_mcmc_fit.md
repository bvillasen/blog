I ran 3 sets of simulation grids for different H reionization times parametrized by $$\Delta z$$. From fitting each grid individually I get the following set of posterior distributions for the warm dark matter mass $$m_{\mathrm{WDM}}$$ and the amplitude of the HI photoinization $$\beta_{\mathrm{H}}^{\mathrm{ion}}$$ and photoheating rate $$\alpha E_{\mathrm{H}}$$.

The marginalized flux power spectrum for each fit is below:

The marginalized temperature evolution for each fit is below:

### Fit from the full grid


Now I perform the fit from the full grid (600 simulations), below are the results:
