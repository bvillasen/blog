## P(k) of the Initial Condtions Density (DM-Only  $$z=100$$) for CDM and 3.0kev WDM mass

### From a grid of $$N=1024^3$$ and $$L=25 h^{-1}\mathrm{Mpc}$$

The black dotted line shows the suppressed $$P(k)$$ from the input $$P(k)$$ used by MUSIC to generate
the initial conditions.

### From a grid of $$N=1024^3$$ and $$L=10 h^{-1}\mathrm{Mpc}$$. 

Also showing $$P(k)$$ from the density obtained from $$2048^3$$ particles gridded onto a $$1024^3$$ grid. 
Increasing the number of particles by 8 makes a small improvement only.
