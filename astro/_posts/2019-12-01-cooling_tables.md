## HM12 Ionization Rates

Grackle takes the photoionization rates as a function of redshift for the different chemical species.

## Grackle Cooling Tables

Additionally grackle takes in 3-dimensional tables for cooling and heating rates and mean-molecular-weight as a function of H-density, temperature and redshift.
