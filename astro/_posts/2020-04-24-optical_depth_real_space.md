Now I compare the optical depth measured from skewers taking in to account the peculiar velocities of the gas ( redshift space ) and ignoring the peculiar velocities ( real space ).

Here I show the distribution of the average transmitted flux over each  skewer and the effective optical depth computed from the average transmitted flux of each skewer.

The optical depth measured in real space is higher, now lets compare as a function of redshift:
