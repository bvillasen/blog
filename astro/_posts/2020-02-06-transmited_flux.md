The optical depth $$\tau$$ for Ly$$\alpha$$ photon scattering is

$$\tau_{v}=\int n_{\mathrm{HI}} \sigma_{v} d r$$

where $$v$$ is the frequency, $$n_{\mathrm{HI}}$$ is the number density of neutral hydrogen,
$$\sigma_{v}$$ is the cross section of the interaction, and $$dr$$ is the proper path
length element. Assuming a Doppler line profile, so the resulting optical depth is

$$ \tau_{v}=\frac{\pi e^{2}}{m_{e} c} f_{12} \int \frac{n_{\mathrm{HI}}}{\Delta v_{D}} \frac{\exp \left[-\left(\frac{v-v_{0}}{\Delta v_{D}}\right)^{2}\right]}{\sqrt{\pi}} d r $$
