## Fitting to $$T_0$$ and $$\tau_{eff}$$

Seems like the paramters $$\beta_{\mathrm{He}}$$, $$\beta_{\mathrm{H}}$$, and $$\Delta z_{\mathrm{He}}$$ are constrained to a reasonable degree but there is no constrain for $$\Delta z_{\mathrm{H}}$$.

Below is the interpolated evolution of $$\tau_{eff}$$ for some values of $$\Delta z_{\mathrm{H}}$$, it seems like there is something wrong for the $$\Delta z_{\mathrm{H}} = 0.15$$ trajectories.

Below are the UVB rates for the simulates values of $$\Delta z_{\mathrm{H}}$$ and all the other parameters constant, apparently nothing wrong here.
