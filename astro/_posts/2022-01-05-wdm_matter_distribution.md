## Gas density distribution

From a set of simulations ($$L=50\,h^{-1}\mathrm{Mpc}$$, $$N=1024^{3}$$) I measure the distribution of the gas overdensity $$\Delta$$ at different redshits and for several warm Dar Matter masses and CDM. As shown the volume with densities close to the mean density increases for lower WDM masses, this explains the increase $$HI$$ opacity of the IGM meassured for low WDM mass simulations
