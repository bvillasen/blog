## Gas density distribution

From a set of simulations ($$L=50\,h^{-1}\mathrm{Mpc}$$, $$N=1024^{3}$$) I measure the **volume weighted  distribution** of the gas overdensity $$\Delta$$ at different redshits and for several warm Dar Matter masses and CDM. As shown, the volume with densities close to the mean density increases for lower WDM masses, this explains the increase $$HI$$ opacity of the IGM meassured for low WDM mass simulations

## DM density power_spectrum

Now I measure the power spectrum of the Dark Matter density fluctuations. WDM suppresses the power on small scales but it doesn't affect the large scales.
