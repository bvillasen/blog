**Column 1:**  ENZO

**Column 2:**  Phase diagram for All Gas ( top ) and Neutral Hydrogen ( bottom ). Temperature is internally computed by Grackle on run time.

**Column 3:**  Phase diagram for the fraction of the gas that uses the Total Internal Energy to compute pressure.

**Column 4:**  Phase diagram for the fraction of the gas that uses the Adavected Internal Energy to compute pressure.


**Column 5:**  Phase diagram showing the temperature computed from the Total Internal Energy for ALL the gas.

**Column 6:**  Phase diagram showing the temperature computed from the Advected Internal Energy for ALL the gas.

Here is the phase diagram using PLMP for the reconstruction method and without the  $$p \nabla \cdot \mathbf{v} $$ term for the half-step update on VL
