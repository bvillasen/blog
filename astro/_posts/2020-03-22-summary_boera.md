They ran a suite of 30 simulations most of them consist of a 10 Mpc/h box and $$2 \times 512^3$$ gas and dark matter particles. The simulations differ on the amplitude of and time of start for the photoheating rates ( they don't explicitly mention that they also changed the photoionization rates ), they heating rates are just the original HM12 rates multiplied by a constant $$\epsilon_{i}=\zeta \epsilon_{i}^{H M 12}$$, where $$\zeta$$ takes the following values [ 0.3, 0.55, 1.0, 1.8, 3.3 ]
