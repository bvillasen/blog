Here is the Zeldovich Pancake test for 3 different cases:

**1** Using Only **Advected** Internal Energy ( Blue Line )

**2** Using Only **Total** Internal Energy ( Orange Line )

**3** Using Only **Total** Internal Energy and **No Gravity** ( Green Line )

Without Gravity The Thermal Energy remains normal, but the kinetic energy is 10 times smaller. Possible conclusions: the gravity coupling is not correct for the total energy ( but it is correct for the momentum ) or in this regime where the kinetic energy is lower we don't see possible errors filtering from the kinetic energy in to the Internal energy.
