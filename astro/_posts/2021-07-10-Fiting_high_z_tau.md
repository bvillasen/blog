Our model doesn't match the $$z > 5 $$ HI Effective Optical Depth, to fix it I will try to modify the HI photoionization ( and photoheating ) rates to change the amount of neutral Hydrogen.

Fraction of neutral Hydrogen from the Modified P19 model and fraction rescaled to match the Effective Optical Depth from Bosman 2021 (SAZERAC).
