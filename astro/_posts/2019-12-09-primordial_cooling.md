From [Katz et al. 1995](https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9509107) I get the cooling rates gas of primordial composition and no incident radiation. Here are the cooling rates for the different processes:


The composition dor the gas is: $$n_{H} = 1$$  $$n_{He} = 0.1$$

Here is the comparison of the cooling rates from Katz+1995 the results from Cloudy and Grackle.

Using the older  Cloudy version c13 (instead of c17) the cooling rates match the ones in the Grackle file, my guess is that Grackle used cloudy c13 to compoute their tables.
