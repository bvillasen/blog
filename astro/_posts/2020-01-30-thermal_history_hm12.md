Thermal History for the 2048$$^3$$ simulation with HM12 UV Background:

<div style="text-align: center">

</div>

Here I show the bands for the measured values of $$T_0$$ and $$\gamma$$ and the with of the band is the uncertainty on the measurement.

The uncertainties are very small, specially for $$T_0$$, so instead I now plot separately the mean values of $$T_0$$ and $$\gamma$$ as a function of redshift on the left column and the fractional uncertainty on the right columns.
