I extracted the $$P(k)$$ data directly from the files provided in the supplementary data from the publication. The normalization (and the shape in some cases) seems completely off

From their paper:

<img src="{{ site.url }}assets/images/gaikwad_ps_1.png">




Both images show $$P(k)$$ at z=3.0, the images show different measurements.
