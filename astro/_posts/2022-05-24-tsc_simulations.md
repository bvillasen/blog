**The simulations below are for L=25 Mpc/h and N=1024$$^3$$ grids. Same as our simulation grid.**

## Matter Power Spectrum

Evolution of the power spectrum for a CDM and a WDM=4kev simulations. Dashed lines correspond to the WDM simulation.

### CIC

### TSC

## Flux Power Spectrum

Now I compare the matter power spectrum ( DM and gas ) and also the Flux P(k) for the CIC and TSC simulations at the redshifts 
from the observations

### z= 4.6

### z= 4.2

**Despite some differences in the gas matter power spectrum between CIC and TSC, the flux power spectrum shows small differences on the scales probed by the observations**
