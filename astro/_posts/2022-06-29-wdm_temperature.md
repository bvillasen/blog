Here I rescale the temperature along the skewers by $$1 / temp_factor$$.

The effect is that the flattening of the suppression of Flux $$P(k)$$ from WDM with respect to CDM is less significant.

This seems to indicate that the flattening is physical and it is due to other mechanisms that suppress small-scale power and mask the 
suppression of density fluctuations from WDM
