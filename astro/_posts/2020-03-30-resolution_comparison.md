Here I compare the Flux Measurements for simulations using the **Puchwein+19** UV Background. 


For all simulations the box size is **50 Mpc/h** and the different computational grids are: $$2048^3$$,   $$1024^3$$  and  $$512^3$$

### Optical Depth

At higher redshits, the optical depth increases as resolution decreases but it still doesnt look like the one in Puchwein paper ( blue line in figure below )

This is what **Onorbe+2017** show for their optical depth resolution analysis:
