Power Spectrum for a $$256^3$$ simulation, full lines correspond to CHOLLA_PM and each dashed line bellow a full line corresponds to the GADGET counterpart

I believe the initial conditions for the gas ( Gadget particles interpolated into a grid ) are causing the differences for the small structure in the gas component.
