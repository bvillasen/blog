Link to the text files containing the marginalized Photoheating and Photoionization rates are below:


**In each file the columns correspond to:**

- 0: Redshift
- 1: HI Photoheating Rate
- 2: HeI Photoheating Rate
- 3: HeII Photoheating Rate
- 4: HI Photoionization Rate
- 5: HeI Photoionization Rate
- 6: HeII Photoionization Rate
