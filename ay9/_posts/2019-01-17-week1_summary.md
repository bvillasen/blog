We talked about the code we will use for running the Dark Matter  simulations **Gadget2**, the link is here: [GADGET2] ( https://wwwmpa.mpa-garching.mpg.de/gadget/ )

We mentioned that the simulations have millions of particles and we need to find the regions were particles density is high ( regions were thew particles are clustered due to gravity ) these regions are the dark matter halos.

We will use ROCKSTAR as our halo finder, rockstar will receive the outputs from the simulation and will return the halo catalogs, which is a list of all the halos and the properties of of each halo: position, velocities, mass, spin, shape, etc.

You can find ROCKSTAR here:   [ ROCKSTAR ] ( https://bitbucket.org/gfcstanford/rockstar )
